  <h2>Number Shifting Game</h2>
  <p>Number shifting game is something I enjoyed playing during
 my childhood. It is a simple game cheaply manufactured by
 some plastic toy industry, usually available at railway platform
 local vendors who sell toys.</p>
 
 <p> The game is a simple puzzle which is some kind of challenge
 to every brain. It is addictive and fun too.</p>
 
 <p>Total 6 videos covering explanation of complete development process
. You can use it for learning how to develop such small projects. </p>

<h2>Why paid content?</h2>
<p>I am on a mission to provide education at zero cost for all
students who are less privileged financially and also to those who 
think that English is the elementary barrier in their learning
process. I love to build confidence in students. </p>
<p>I believe that I am working on filling gaps in Indian education 
system which also helps to the neighbouring countries like 
Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. </p>
<p> Only good education can change the world. Education gives you
ability to find soultion to the problems. Poverty is a common problem,
religious misinterpretation is another problem. This happens because people 
are so free and uneducated, and can be misguided by any criminal mind.</p>
<p>You may think why I charge for some content? First of all it takes some
cost to help people like managing technical stuff and services required
to run my website. I need staff to manage things. And I do not want donations.
So I prefer to sell few learning content at a very low cost, which is not a burdon 
for you as a student, but actually you are contributing to the system which is providing
several hundreds of FREE learning videos.</p>
<p> Say you paid Rs. 50 for some content. What this amount means to you? One day fuel for your
bike or cost of a register or may be cost of some fast food. Many students
when spend Rs 50 each on the same content I received a big amount, which I can use 
to provide good services to you. Also this will help me to make this system running
for several years.</p>
<p>You must have experienced that a good quality education is very rare. So I expect you to 
understand why I am selling some of my content. This will ultimately benefiting back to the society.
</p>
<p>Your little contribution means a lot to the system. </p>
